BETWIXT MINE EYE AND HEART A LEAGUE IS TOOK,
AND EACH DOTH GOOD TURNS NOW UNTO THE OTHER
WHEN THAT MINE EYE IS FAMISHED FOR A LOOK,
OR HEART IN LOVE WITH SIGHS HIMSELF DOTH SMOTHER,
WITH MY LOVES PICTURE THEN MY EYE DOTH FEAST,
AND TO THE PAINTED BANQUET BIDS MY HEART
ANOTHER TIME MINE EYE IS MY HEARTS GUEST,
AND IN HIS THOUGHTS OF LOVE DOTH SHARE A PART.
SO EITHER BY THY PICTURE OR MY LOVE,
THYSELF, AWAY, ART PRESENT STILL WITH ME,
FOR THOU NOT FARTHER THAN MY THOUGHTS CANST MOVE,
AND I AM STILL WITH THEM, AND THEY WITH THEE
OR IF THEY SLEEP, THY PICTURE IN MY SIGHT
AWAKES MY HEART TO HEARTS AND EYES DELIGHT.

NO MORE BE GRIEVED AT THAT WHICH THOU HAST DONE
ROSES HAVE THORNS, AND SILVER FOUNTAINS MUD,
CLOUDS AND ECLIPSES STAIN BOTH MOON AND SUN,
AND LOATHSOME CANKER LIVES IN SWEETEST BUD.
ALL MEN MAKE FAULTS, AND EVEN I IN THIS,
AUTHRIZING THY TRESPASS WITH COMPARE,
MYSELF CORRUPTING SALVING THY AMISS,
EXCUSING THY SINS MORE THAN THEIR SINS ARE
FOR TO THY SENSUAL FAULT I BRING IN SENSE
THY ADVERSE PARTY IS THY ADVOCATE
AND GAINST MYSELF A LAWFUL PLEA COMMENCE
SUCH CIVIL WAR IS IN MY LOVE AND HATE
THAT I AN CCESSARY NEEDS MUST BE
TO THAT SWEET THIEF WHICH SOURLY ROBS FROM ME.

AS AN UNPERFECT ACTOR ON THE STAGE,
WHO WITH HIS FEAR IS PUT BESIDES HIS PART,
OR SOME FIERCE THING REPLETE WITH TOO MUCH RAGE,
WHOSE STRENGTHS ABUNDANCE WEAKENS HIS OWN HEART
SO I, FOR FEAR OF TRUST, FORGET TO SAY
THE PERFECT CEREMONY OF LOVES RITE,
AND IN MINE OWN LOVES STRENGTH SEEM TO DECAY,
OERCHARGED WITH BURDEN OF MINE OWN LOVES MIGHT
O LET MY BOOKS BE THEN THE ELOQUENCE
AND DUMB PRESAGERS OF MY SPEAKING BREAST,
WHO PLEAD FOR LOVE, AND LOOK FOR RECOMPENSE,
MORE THAN THAT TONGUE THAT MORE HATH MORE EXPRESSED.
O LEARN TO READ WHAT SILENT LOVE HATH WRIT
TO HEAR WITH EYES BELONGS TO LOVES FINE WIT.
